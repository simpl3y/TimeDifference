# TimeDifference
Quick tool to find the the difference between two dates.
Made using QT C++ as a tool to use during my internship over the summer.

Todo: Since pressing enter will create a new entry box, after around ~25 entries the stacked entry boxes will become taller than the mainwindow itself. Because the mainwindow currently does not resize, the entry boxes will reduce their height after each newly created entry box resulting in unreadable text after ~30 entries. Next version will have the mainwindow expand or a cap on how many entry boxes made.
